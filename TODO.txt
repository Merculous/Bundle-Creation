Add a check when --make --ipsw is being used (ipsw making), we don't decrypt the FS twice.

Move ramdisk patching when creating bundles, or wherever it can fit in. While I patch ASR
and restored_external when only making ipsw's, its still needed for all versions essentially.
Also, create .patch files to utilize already patched ASR/restored_external so that I don't have
to find offsets again. This will also allow xpwn (ipsw binary) to make use of the patches. I'm
not too sure whether it will grow the ramdisk, but I think I can set the size, but I haven't
messed with ramdisk patching from xpwn only yet.

Add Cydia support. This will require adding untether debs.
Cydia is done, but I'll have to accuire all untether debs to use.

Figure out how to patch restored_external/kernel regarding NOR for 3.x.

Rewrite again. There's some renaming that needs to be done for a lot of modules.
Tbh, a lot of stuff can be moved to other places.

Allow keeping keys.

Symlink 7z automatically for whatever platform.

Compile binaries for Darwin, and possibly Windows. However, Windows users can and should use
WSL to use this project, in fact, that's exactly what I've been using to work with this project.

Ensure fstab is correct as this seems to be a reoccuring issue.
